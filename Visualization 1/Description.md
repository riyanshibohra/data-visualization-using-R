## Folder 1 Description:

The visualizations in this folder analyze vehicular crashes across different New York City boroughs based on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, and night). The dataset used originates from the Serious Injury Response, Tracking & Analysis Program (SIRTA) maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation. It provides insights into crash patterns that could inform city planning and safety initiatives. This folder includes:

- **Dataset:** 

The dataset originates from the Serious Injury Response, Tracking & Analysis Program (SIRTA) maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYC DOT). It offers a comprehensive overview of severe vehicular crashes within New York City, capturing key details such as the date and time of the crash, precise location coordinates, the borough in which the incident occurred, and metrics on the severity of the crash, including non-severe injuries, severe injuries, and fatalities. Additional data points include street information, nearby landmarks, zip codes, and historical data on similar incidents in the past three years at the same locations. This dataset is instrumental for urban traffic safety analysis and infrastructure decisions.

- **Visualization Plot:** A bar plot showing the total number of crashes across boroughs, segmented by time of day.
     -  **First Plot:** Demonstrates effective data visualization techniques, with a clean, clear, and informative bar plot that shows the total number of crashes across boroughs, segmented by time of day.
     - **Second Plot:** Illustrates common visualization errors, such as unclear labeling, indistinguishable colors, distracting background elements, and poor data presentation, to highlight how improper design choices can mislead or confuse the viewer.
     
- **R Markdown File:** The R code used to clean, process, and visualize the data, along with explanations of the plot and its significance.


This approach not only showcases how to create meaningful visualizations but also teaches the importance of avoiding common pitfalls in data visualization.
