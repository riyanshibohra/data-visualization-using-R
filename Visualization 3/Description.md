## Folder 3 Description:
This folder contains a dashboard showcasing air quality trends across different seasons, with a focus on particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) levels. The data is sourced from the Daily Particulate Air Quality dataset and covers air quality indices (AQI) in various regions, highlighting seasonal trends and the best and worst air quality locations.

- **Dataset:** The Daily Particulate Air Quality dataset (Daily Particulate Air Quality.csv), which captures AQI data across different regions and seasons.
- **Visualization :** 
  1. **Positive Report:** This dashboard displays the average AQI for the seasons with the best air quality (Spring and Summer). It identifies the county and site with the best AQI, with a breakdown of the number of “Good AQI” days per season.
  2. **Negative Report:** This dashboard highlights seasons with the worst air quality (Fall and Winter), showing trends in AQI values for PM2.5 and PM10. It includes the county and site with the worst AQI and provides a count of “Bad AQI” days by season.
  
This folder serves to illustrate both best practices and common errors in visualizing time-series data.
