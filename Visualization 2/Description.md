## Folder 2 Description:
This folder contains visualizations analyzing UFO sightings between 1910 and 2014, using data sourced from the National UFO Reporting Center dataset on Kaggle. The dataset includes the number of sightings and categorizes them based on U.S. regions (Northeast, Midwest, West, and South). This folder showcases two types of visualizations: effective visualizations and those illustrating common pitfalls.

- **Dataset:** The UFO sightings dataset (UFO complete.csv), providing details of the UFO sightings.
- **Visualization Plot:** A bar plot showing the total number of crashes across boroughs, segmented by time of day.
      1. **First Set of Plots:** Two well-designed line plots.The first plot (Panel A) shows the total number of UFO sightings globally over time, highlighting a sharp increase in sightings since 1995. The second plot (Panel B) breaks down the sightings by region, showing regional differences in sighting frequencies across the U.S.
      2. **Second Set of Plots:** Two alternative visualizations using a logarithmic scale to demonstrate potential issues with data presentation.These plots use the same data but highlight the challenges that arise when using log scales for certain types of data, which can distort interpretation.
  
- **R Markdown File:** The R code used to generate both the well-designed and the log-scaled plots, offering insight into effective and ineffective data visualization techniques.

This folder serves to illustrate both best practices and common errors in visualizing time-series data.
